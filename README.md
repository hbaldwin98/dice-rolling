# diceRollingGUI
A simple Python program written using Tkinter that allows rolling of various sides of dice. Outputs the average rolls of dice rolls, the summation of rolls, and allows for multiple rolls at once. 

This was made mostly just to see the average rolls of dice for Dungeons & Dragons, though it supports any number and side of die.
